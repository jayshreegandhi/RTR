I = 70
character 1 (after ch_1 = i) = F

Character 2 = Q
J (after j = ch_ 2) = 81

Integer a = 5 and Floating-point number 7.800000 added gives floating-point sum =12.800000

Integer a = 5 and Floating-point number 7.800000 added gives integer sum =12

Floating point number type casted explicitly = 30.121996
Resultant integer after explicit type casting of 30.121996 = 30
