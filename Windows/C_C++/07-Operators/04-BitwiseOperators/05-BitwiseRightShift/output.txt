Enter a integer : 5

Enter another integer : 3

By how many bits do you want to shift A = 5 to the right ? : 2

By how many bits do you want to shift B = 3 to the right ? : 1

Bitwise RIGHT-SHIFT by 2 bits of  
A = 5 (Decimal), 5 (Octal), 5 (Hexadecimal) 
gives the result = 1 (Decimal), 1 (Octal), 1 (Hexadecimal)

the binary form of the decimal integer 5 is 	=	00000101

the binary form of the decimal integer 1 is 	=	00000001



Bitwise RIGHT-SHIFT by 1 bits of  
B = 3 (Decimal), 3 (Octal), 3 (Hexadecimal) 
gives the result = 1 (Decimal), 1 (Octal), 1 (Hexadecimal)

the binary form of the decimal integer 3 is 	=	00000011

the binary form of the decimal integer 1 is 	=	00000001
